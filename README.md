# MAR-GCNet: Multi-label Abnormal Detection of Electrocardiograms by Combining Multiscale Features and Graph Convolutional Networks
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, and timely, accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. In this paper, we introduce MAR-GCNet, a novel deep learning framework for multi-label ECG anomaly detection that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with inter-class correlation modeling. Our approach employs Multi-Attention Residual Networks (MARNs) built on ECA-ResNet blocks with convolutional kernels of varying sizes (3, 5, and 7) to capture both local and global temporal features from 12-lead ECG signals. Complementing this, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) module utilizes a Conditional Probability Matrix (CPM) and a Multi-Label Feature Matrix (MLFM) to effectively model the complex co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity patterns among cardiac abnormalities. The outputs from these two modules are fused via a weighted fusion strategy and optimized using a multi-loss framework. Experiments on the PTB-XL dataset show that MAR-GCNet outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across various annotation levels, achieving the F1 scores of 72.68%, 66.80%, 69.46%, 76.84%, 52.06%, and 90.97% in the "all," "diag," "sub-diag," "super-diag," "form," and "rhythm" tasks, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that the integration of multi-scale feature extraction and the two-layer GCN configuration significantly enhance the model performance. These results highlight the potential of MAR-GCNet as a robust, automated tool for comprehensive ECG analysis in clinical settings.
